An MVC framework for PHP
...inspired by rails, (quite) a bit. the inflector algorithm was from rails.

INSTRUCTIONS!
-------------

1. Extract everything (except README and CHANGELOG, perhaps) to the folder
   above your VirtualHost's directory (i.e. the public_html or htdocs folder)

2. If you use a public_html directory, move .htaccess and index.php
   from htdocs/ to public_html/

3. Navigate to wherever you mapped the folder. Be careful not to have
   'index.php' at the end of the address.

4. You should be greeted with a useless message.

5. If everything went OK until this far, you should be safe to play around
   with the controllers and views. The models too, if you want.

6. Mess around with the super-cool routing by editing conf/routes.php.
   --- yes, you can load /sample

7. The main configuration file is located at conf/conf.php.
   set $production = false if you want to mess around with the debugger
   everytime you make yourself an error.

8. To configure the database connection, define the variables
	- $db_user
	- $db_pass
	- $db_name
	- $db_host (defaults to localhost, of course)
   in a file called conf/db.php.
